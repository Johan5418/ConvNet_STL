# ConvNet_STL

## Overview

This project aims to investigate the suitability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the STL-10 image dataset.
We examine its mechanisms and performance using the TensorFlow and Pytorch backends, and explore various methods
to improve final classification accuracy, with further discussion into the use of alternative activation functions and their
feasibility for this scenario.


## Tasks Allocations:

    - Donald: Adapt Tensorflow and Pytorch model, fine-tune CNN architecture for optimal performance. 

    - Hoong Ler: Analyse and interpret CNN architecture, provided theoretical support and advice.

    - Johan: Implementaion of Pytorch model, explored alternative methods of neural activation for use in CNN.

    - Tat Xian: Data pre-processing and augmentation, provided technical advice.
